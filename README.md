# Welcome to EKU's R User Group

The R User Group at EKU exists to support the development of students and faculty in using R Statistical Software in data analysis and presentation. Meetings occur on the **last Tuesday** of each month at the Noel Studio - Breakout Room 3, from 2:15 - 3:15 PM.

## Installing R on your Computer

While it is not required that you have access to R to attend the meetings, it may enhance the experience if you have it on your computer when you arrive.  We recommend downloading and installing two software packages.

1. Download R [here](https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/)
2. Download R Studio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop)

It is crucial that you install R first (if not RStudio will not work) and we ask that you do this before coming to the meetings. If you have questions regarding the installation, arrive a few minutes early and we will be happy to help you.

The [video in this link](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwDqxHWvCtjBvjSBvTbKWDCXfDv?projector=1) will walk you through the installation process.

## Mini Challenges

Each month we offer a new mini challenge to give you an opportunity to learn something new in R. You can see all of our mini challenges on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EKUResearchAnalysis/RUserGroup/tree/master/MiniChallenge).
